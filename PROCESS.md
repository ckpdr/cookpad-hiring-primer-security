# Technical exercise process

Someone from our technical team will grant you access to a private Github repo at a time that's
been pre-arranged with you. The repo will contain the instructions with the problem's description and
(possibly) some code examples.

You should work on the exercise for around 2 hours.

## Guidance

- **Prioritise demonstrating big wins**, rather than devoting too much time to fixing
  little problems. Bear in mind that to provide a fully comprehensive solution to the exercise
  might take longer than the allotted time. In our evaluation, we are not focused on the code
  running 100% correctly. We are more interested to see an end to end solution/scaffold focusing
  on aspects that demonstrate your experience, knowledge, creativity, etc.
- **Treat the codebase as your own**. Do not feel constrained in parts of the repository you can edit.
  You are welcome to make any changes to the code (or tooling or anything else) that you see is a
  priority.

## Process

Before the exercise:

- You should have access to this Primer Repo.
- You should have provided Cookpad with your Github username.
- You should have arranged a date and time for the exercise.

The start of the exercise:

- At the arranged time, your Github user will receive an invitation to a private repository
  containing the Exercise. Keep an eye on your e-mails and Github account. The invite will be sent
  at, or soon after, the arranged time.

During the exercise:

- **IMPORTANT:** Once you have access, you should **immediately fork** the repository. This way we
  can make sure that there won't be any technical issues later for pushing the solution. You should
  ensure your fork is a **private repository** (this is the default Github behaviour).
- You should work on the problem for 2 hours.

To submit the exercise:

- A pull request should be created from your fork to the original Cookpad repository. We will only
  consider commits that were created during the 2 hour window, so **don't forget to push your
  final commit** within the time window. If you prefer to create the pull request to the repo
  immediately, before beginning work on the solution, that is also fine.

## Follow up

We'll confirm that we have received your Pull Request and then the team will review your submission.
We'll try to be in touch within 3 working days of your submission to let you know the outcome and to discuss
any possible next steps.
