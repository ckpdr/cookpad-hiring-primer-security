# Technical exercise process

Someone from our technical team will grant you access to a private Github repo at a time that's
been pre-arranged with you. The repo will contain instructions and a Rails project.

Try to spend no more than 2 hours on the exercise. It doesn't have to be all in one go, but do let us know when you're finished (tag us on Github for review). Note that we do not want to see every single vulnerability in the test repo fixed, we are more interested in _how_ you resolve them rather than _how many_ you resolve. If you have any questions, ping us on github.

## Guidance

- **Prioritise demonstrating big wins**, rather than devoting too much time to fixing
  little problems. Bear in mind that resolving every single vulnerability in the test repo
  will take a long time, and is out of scope for the assignment. In our evaluation we are more interested in how you explain the vulnerabilities you find (and the fixes you suggest) than if you present us with a totally 'secure' test repo. A small number of really well explained vulnerabilities and suggested solutions is ideal. We are interested to see how you think about and discuss vulnerabilities, demonstrating your experience, knowledge, creativity, etc.
- **Treat the codebase as your own**. Do not feel constrained in parts of the repository you can edit.
  You are welcome to make any changes to the code (or tooling or anything else) that you see is a
  priority.

## Process

Before the exercise:

- You should have access to this Primer Repo.
- You should have provided Cookpad with your Github username.
- You should have arranged a date and time to begin the exercise.

The start of the exercise:

- Your Github user will receive an invitation to a private repository
  containing the Exercise. Keep an eye on your e-mails and Github account. We'll try to arrange a time so you know when to expect it.

During the exercise:

- **IMPORTANT:** Once you have access, you should **immediately fork** the repository. This way we
  can make sure that there won't be any technical issues later for pushing the solution. You should
  ensure your fork is a **private repository** (this is the default Github behaviour).
- You should work on the problem for a maximum of 2 hours.

To submit the exercise:

- Pull requests should be created from your fork to the original Cookpad repository. If you prefer to create pull requests to the repo immediately, before beginning work on the solution, that is also fine. Just make sure to let us know when you're finished.

## Follow up

We'll confirm that we have received your Pull Request(s) and then the team will review your submission.
We'll try to be in touch within 3 working days of your submission to let you know the outcome and to discuss
any possible next steps.
