# Cookpad - Security - Technical exercise primer

This is a primer to prepare you for the Security Technical Exercise. Please read through this repo
before the date of your exercise. This will minimise the amount of set-up time you need to do.

Please make sure that you can follow the instructions on [this page](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v7.0/getting_started.html) to install and successfully run a Rails application. You should be able to get to the end of [section 4.1](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v7.0/getting_started.html#starting-up-the-web-server).

Guidelines to understand how the process works for the technical exercise [here](PROCESS.md).
