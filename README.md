# Cookpad - Security - Technical exercise primer

This is a primer to prepare you for the Security Technical Exercise. Please read through this repo
before the date of your exercise. This will minimise the amount of set-up time you need to do.

First of all, please make sure that you can install the same packages in your environment using the [Gemfile](Gemfile) included in this repository.

Guidelines to understand how the process works for the technical exercise [here](PROCESS.md).
